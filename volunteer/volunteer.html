      <h2>Girls of Promise, December Coding Summit</h2>

      <h2>GiveCamp Northwest Arkansas</h2>
      <p>October 2018</p>
      <p>Volunteered as a software developer and helped develop and implement a cohesive contact form for the Arkansas Crisis Center that would compile results into a single source. This form replaced their previous contact form which just linked to
        a
        popular email newsletter service, and allows the client to filter the results, add other information to the form, and export the data. This will majorly cut down the physical paperwork the client was doing, and helps serve as a database of
        donors and various types of volunteers.</p>
