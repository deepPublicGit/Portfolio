      <p class="header__body--description">I love volunteering as a way to use my knowledge and position to uplift my community. My favorite events are teaching girls about code: I've taught Hour of Code modules, used micro:bit devices to give an introduction to hardware through software, and always accentuate my lessons with a history of women in tech. I also build websites for non-profits and social causes. My volunteerism has allowed me to live my passion for coding.</p>

        <p class="description">I volunteered as a software developer and helped develop and implement a cohesive contact form for the Arkansas Crisis Center that would compile results into a single source. This form replaced their previous contact form which just linked to a popular email newsletter service, and allows the client to filter the results, add other information to the form, and export the data. This will majorly cut down the physical paperwork the client was doing, and helps serve as a database of donors and various types of volunteers.</p>
